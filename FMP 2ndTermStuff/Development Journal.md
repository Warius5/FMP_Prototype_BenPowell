### Planninng for term

<P> After using mostly blueprints for the prototype, i want to take the current state of the game and use it to practice C++ and specifcally Unreal C++, and as i already have things done in the project it will be easier than figuring it out from scratch. 
<p> To better figure out how to turn it from blueprints, to C++ i want to create a proper map of the workings of the project, so i can better see how the different parts and managers interact with each other. This will help me be able to fix or change things, and then also how to expand it from the current.
