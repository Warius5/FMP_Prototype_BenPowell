### Planninng for term

<P> After using mostly blueprints for the prototype, i want to take the current state of the game and use it to practice C++ and specifcally Unreal C++, and as i already have things done in the project it will be easier than figuring it out from scratch. 
<p> To better figure out how to turn it from blueprints, to C++ i want to create a proper map of the workings of the project, so i can better see how the different parts and managers interact with each other. This will help me be able to fix or change things, and then also how to expand it from the current.
<p> I will use user feedback to inform my choices going from my prototype and see what people would or expect there to be in the game.
<p> I also want to try to use procedural generation to create a roguelike system, as i have not used it before. So there may be some issue making that work with the overall context of the game.
<p> I want to create a game that feels good for someone to play, where the choices of which item or choice they pick will be satisfying. And it will build over time to create powerful characters to defeat dangerous bosses.

### Battle Style

"The key characteristic of RT systems is that all, or almost all, of the gameplay takes place in real-time."

"combatants act in turns, usually one at a time. Other combatants are typically unable
to move or perform actions outside of their own turn"

From the evaluation made by this paper, using infomation gathered from forum posts to generate overall opinions on the strengths and weaknesses of the different battle styles. Real time seems to point towards single character, intense action and being problematic having multiple party members. Also as there is no direct control while the combat is going, having real time actions do not make sense.
Real time with pause is a possible idea, as it allows party management and tactical depth. However it also does not really gain from being real time with the features planned. 
Turn based does have some issues with it being possibly boring or tedious due to the same animations being played over and over. Also some turn based games can be predictable if there is an obivious un-changing order to the combat. With

## Initial User feedback

### Results

Big part was UI and not knowing waht the attack value was.

From the questionaire, the main consensus is selecting the item first, and then the character wanting to be equipped. 
Dragging the item is also a popular way of equipping the items, and it gives a good visual of actually 'equipping' the items. This will help with the confusion felt by the testers on, what order they need to click things and what characters are being equipped.
Having effects and visuals will help show whats going on a provide a feedback effect to the player on what they're doing. 
The super auto pet; shop and item drag mechanic, creates a clear and easy to tell way of selecting an item, and then showing the selecting of the character to add the item to. The item having clear details on what it does and how much it is.

The clear details on what things do really makes it easier to play smoothly in Super Auto Pet's. Form the feedback, knowing what is equipped and how that is affecting the character, as well as seeing the stat values of the characters easily is something that is important.
