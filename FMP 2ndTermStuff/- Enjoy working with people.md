- Enjoy working with people. Much more enjoy the scrum/ project managery stuff. 
- I like talking about interesting thigns.like learning stuff. Master's to learn more/ do more learning? 
- I wanted to use the project to learn an intersting technology or part, as a way to research and gain some skill in a more niche thing. 
- Although turns out the part i thought would give that is something that isnt interesting to me. So when i do get round to working, while i do like the problem solving, im not feeling the elation of 'finsihing/ fixing' something as much, which i felt alot more at the start.  Because i do enjoy the problem solving such as for the tasks in lesson.
- Wish i could ask for proper help more easily?
- need a better plan of what i need to do, so i can chunk it off more easily. Becuase i dont really know what i need to do to turn it into a finished thing? Whole idea seems very nothing burger, not even the sort of game i play, weird that id want to make a game like it?
- do i want to make games? what else would i do? I do, just not sure whether id want to be a developer for very long? project managery sounds like it could be interesting, knowing whats going on, meetings, talking to people? BUt like is that the sort of thing id be good at?
- had this idea of doing game dev for so so long, idk what id even do other than, or how, and seems like a waste of time and money to not keep doing it, but dont feel like i know enough to become a real developer, so want to do a masters to learn more. But is that just me putting it off for a year? I feel like game dev has always been my calling? but the call is certainly getting quieter? or i cant hear it anymore, and need to find it again?
- on a open evening a couple weeks ago i was talking to a potential person who was worried they didnt know enough / or was new to coding but not games industry. And then i  spent 10 minutes talking to them about concepts and ways they could learn that i had learnt here, and i felt really good about it, because i felt like i knew stuff. But then sometimes i feel like i dont know anything or enough.

What do i want?
- my mum wants me to get a first, i also want one, feel like my game doenst have the need for technical complexity or anything to get me there..? 
    - complexity != good grade
    - clean code + good write up + little/ no bugs + polished game = good grade
- can research and i can write decent enough, but idk if my actual work would get me there.
    - plenty of sources, source everything, games, anything.
    - lots of pictures and annotations.
    - blueprintue.com
    - gifs & videos, the more the better.
- should get more certifs, got a bunch mentioned bookmarked, but need to do more. The classic bookmark to do later, which i never get round to.
    - do them, do them now.
    - you only need like a few language ones, generally if you know a language well, you can learn others pretty quickly with a decent book and making a project.
    - what is more important is git certificaton, aws certification. this will make a massive difference for jobs available to you.
- More guidance of where i need to take the game, currently dealing with getting the map nodes to work. but when ive finally got that done, not sure what things i got to do? whether thats adding mroe stuff? or adding looks stuff wise? idk if the mechanics ive done is enough for the project or the game? 
    - you should have a definative list of all tasks required to submission, no areas which are unplanned. if you complete all the tasks, and everything is fine, you are ahead. now you can build on top of this to add further functionality.
