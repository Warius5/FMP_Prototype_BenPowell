### Time Keeping

>To help with time keeping for the project, i was recommended to use Trello to plan out the different sprints with parts of the game.
<br> I will still need to research into what good versions of these systems are in similiar games, as well as research how things with work or be done.

> Attempting to get the trello board to embed into the markup to better show it off rather than using screen shots, however it has not seemd to work so far, even when going to different html sites. 
<br>
> After narrowing it down to the public/ private access of the board, i changed it to public and after seemingly it not working, it did and now embedds into the markdown file. I think it may have just taken a bit for the board to update to being public. (1)
