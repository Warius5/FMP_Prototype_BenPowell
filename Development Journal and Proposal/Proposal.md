Here’s a clearer and more detailed version of your **Medieval or Medieval Fantasy Roguelike with Autobattler Combat** idea, along with an expanded list of possible mechanics and deeper details.

---

### **Game Design Proposal: Medieval/Fantasy Roguelike Autobattler**

---

**Core Concept:**
- The game is a **roguelike** set in a medieval or fantasy setting where players lead a group of humans (or other characters) through dungeons, castles, or labyrinths.
- Combat is handled in **autobattler style** with characters acting on their own, based on their stats, but players influence outcomes through strategic preparation, equipment, and decision-making.

---

### **Core Gameplay Mechanics:**

1. **Party Composition and Management:**
   - Players start with a group of **normal humans** or weak fantasy characters, but they grow in power through the game.
   - **Stats** for each character include:
     - **Health**: How much damage they can take.
     - **Stamina**: How many actions they can take in a fight before needing rest or recovery.
     - **Speed**: Affects their **position in the turn order** during autobattler combat (faster characters attack more often).

2. **Turn-based Autobattler Combat:**
   - Combat is largely automated, with characters attacking based on their stats and equipment.
   - **Speed** determines the attack order, while **stamina** governs how long a character can continue before needing to rest.
   - Players prepare for fights by **equipping weapons and armor**, using consumables, and strategically managing their party’s positions.

3. **Inventory and Equipment System:**
   - Each character can be equipped with different **weapons, armor, and items**.
   - Items and gear vary in rarity and effectiveness and can be found or earned through encounters.
   - Equipment can be **enhanced or infused** with elemental crystals (explained below) to modify their stats or add new effects.
   
4. **Roguelike Exploration and Map Choices:**
   - The game is structured around a procedurally generated map with branching paths (similar to **Slay the Spire** or **FTL**).
   - Each path/doorway leads to different encounters:
     - **Enemy battles** (standard fights, minibosses, bosses).
     - **Puzzles or traps** (solving them may reward items or boost stats).
     - **Events or random encounters** (meeting NPCs, gaining new characters, etc.).
     - **Shops** or **rest points** where players can purchase gear, heal, or restore stamina.

### **Labyrinth of Doors & Elemental Crystals:**

1. **Doors and Elemental Crystals:**
   - In some sections of the dungeon or labyrinth, players are presented with a choice of **doors**, each representing an **element** (e.g., fire, ice, lightning, earth, etc.).
   - **Crystals** of the chosen element are awarded upon entering, which can be used in different ways to improve the party:
     - **Infusing Weapons or Armor**: The crystals can be used to apply elemental effects to weapons and armor, giving them special properties such as:
       - Fire crystal: Burns enemies, dealing damage over time.
       - Ice crystal: Slows down enemy speed or freezes them for a turn.
       - Earth crystal: Increases defense or gives a shield.
       - Lightning crystal: Chance to strike additional enemies with chain lightning.
     - **Infusing Characters**: Crystals can also be used directly on characters, granting them **permanent buffs or elemental powers**:
       - Fire-infused characters deal extra damage.
       - Ice-infused characters slow enemies with each hit.
       - Lightning-infused characters have a chance to strike multiple enemies.
   - This adds a layer of **strategic choice**, as players must decide between powering up their characters or enhancing their gear.

2. **Elemental Synergy and Effects:**
   - Different combinations of crystals and equipment can lead to **synergy effects**:
     - Combining different elemental crystals on one character might create hybrid effects (e.g., fire + lightning = electrical explosion damage).
     - Mixing crystals within a party can create team-wide buffs, such as enhanced resistance or area-of-effect damage.

---

### **Procedural Roguelike Mechanics:**

1. **Randomized Routes and Encounters:**
   - Each playthrough offers a new labyrinth/dungeon layout with different paths, enemies, and events.
   - Players can choose routes based on the challenges they want to face, resources they need, or strategic positioning for future encounters.
   
2. **Permadeath & Progression:**
   - Once a character dies, they’re gone for that run, but the player can recruit new characters along the way.
   - Between runs, there may be some form of **meta-progression** where players unlock new classes, items, or starting bonuses for future runs.

---

### **Additional Mechanics & Features:**

1. **Party Classes or Archetypes:**
   - Characters can have different roles or classes within the party (e.g., tank, healer, rogue, mage). Each role affects how they behave in autobattler combat:
     - **Tanks** focus on high health and defense, drawing enemy attacks.
     - **DPS/Assassins** have high speed and deal burst damage.
     - **Support/Healers** restore health or buff the party.
   - New **party members** can be recruited during the run, each offering different abilities and stats.

2. **Events and Encounters:**
   - Random events may involve:
     - **Choosing between multiple rewards** (e.g., sacrifice health for better loot, trade stamina for gold).
     - **Dialogue-based decisions** that could lead to new items or characters joining the party.
     - **Puzzles or mini-games** that grant buffs or rewards if solved correctly.

3. **Character Progression:**
   - Characters level up as they defeat enemies and survive encounters.
   - Leveling up can unlock **new abilities** or improve stats like health, stamina, and speed.
   - Characters could also gain **unique traits or perks** during a run (e.g., gaining resistance to certain elements or increased critical hit chance).

4. **Boss Fights:**
   - Certain points in the labyrinth will feature **boss encounters**, which will require special strategies, proper gear, and optimized party setups.
   - Bosses can have unique abilities and require players to use their elemental powers and autobattler positioning carefully.

### **Potential Pros & Cons:**

#### **Pros:**
- **Variety of Builds**: With the crystal infusion system and equipment customization, players can create highly varied character builds, offering replayability.
- **Strategic Depth**: Combining elements with different classes and party compositions adds a rich layer of tactical decision-making.
- **Procedural Generation**: Randomly generated routes, enemies, and rewards keep each playthrough fresh and challenging.
- **Simple AI**: Autobattler-style combat reduces the need for complex AI, focusing more on preparation and planning.

#### **Cons:**
- **Not Unique Enough**: The autobattler genre combined with roguelike elements could feel derivative unless executed with a unique twist (e.g., crystal system).
- **Item Variety and Complexity**: The need for a large number of items and equipment could distract from the core mechanics. Balance may be difficult if the system is too complex.
- **Balancing Complexity**: The multiple layers of mechanics (crystals, autobattler combat, rogue-like exploration) might lead to design challenges in keeping things manageable while still being fun.

---

### **Additional Mechanics to Consider:**

1. **Meta-Progression Between Runs:**
   - Unlockable starting perks, classes, or bonuses that players can carry over into future runs (e.g., start with a fire crystal, access better weapons from the beginning).
   
2. **Crafting & Item Upgrades:**
   - Allow players to combine materials they find in the dungeon to craft new weapons or armor, or upgrade existing gear with special effects.
   
3. **Puzzle Encounters:**
   - Include mini-games or puzzles where solving them could lead to rare rewards or shortcuts through the dungeon.
