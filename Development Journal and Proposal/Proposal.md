# FMP Proposal

## Idea - Resource node delivery sim(?)
## Game 
- Placing down of resource nodes with payments and time values, decide how much the job will be paid.
- Different resource nodes do different thing
    - Some base generate resource
    - Some take 'ingredients' to produce another resource
    - Some just take things 
- Ai '**drivers**' determine which node/ 'jobs' to take based on what its best job is, and take into other factors such as danger or time requirements
- Map generates events that could affect the values
    - Dangers that the drivers need to avoid 
    - shortcuts or speed ups that will make the time quicker
- Ai pathfinding of quickest route picks which job will be better for them
- Generate most money by changing values to increase profits aswell as the amount the drivers pick your job. (Low supply, increased demand, higher payments. higher supply lower demand, lower payments)
- drivers have different traits that affect their job choice
- Automatic or Player changed? Simulation or game? Versus or singeplayer?
- reactive simulation
## Technology - Unreal 5 
## Tools -
## End Product

## ?

### Pros
- Using more complicated ai and pathfinding
- less of need for artwork or fancy design
- no controlled character movement
### Cons
- May be limited in scope or additions post making the ai work and placing thing.
- possible limit in range of techniques or mechanics on show
- not fun or engaging if not made just a simulation, hard to create good gameplay from the idea due to focus on the ai making descions.


## Idea - Vietnam or modern day military support radio operator
## Game 
- Static map with 'counters' for each of your elements your supporting
- Radio messages from elements asking for support using grid references
- Need to keep up to date with positions and what is going on based on messages or may put stuff in wrong spot.
- Choose what support to call in; medivac, reinforcements, artillery, smoke, translator etc
- Sequence of missions unlocking call ins and getting more difficult, by either more elements to track and things happening faster.
- Landmarks on map used instead of grid refences to make it harder to tell where to send.

## ?

### Pros
- Not alot of moving or complicated assets
- Interesting gimick to an rts where you dont directly control things, and are going off '2nd hand' info

### Cons
- May be hard to give information or easily play without good design / artwork
- alot of testing and complications on back end
- may not be fun or good to play


## Idea - Medieval or Medieval fantasy roguelike with autobattler combat

## Game
- Start with group of normal humans attacking castle or dungeon 
- group members have health, stamina and speed 
- Speed affects when in the turn sequence they attack  
- give weapons and armour to make the characters in party stronger 
- Defeat enemies or solve encounters based on rogue like map choice
- Inventory and equipment for group members
- 
### Labryinth of doors
- Each door has element that once chosen to go through your party gains a crystal of that element 
- Infusing weapons with the crystals apply differnet affects to them, so you make your people stronger by choosing which affects to apply to their armour.
- Or the characters given the power up instead and have weapons be extra choice.
- given power up, given 

## ?
### Pros
- Lots of possible ways to create 
- No compicated ai but some ai showcase
- procedural roguelike route
- 

### Cons
- May not be unique enough to be fun or good
- alot items may need to be made, to make it interesting which could detract from mechanic creation
- different layers of mechanics may cause it to take to long to make.
